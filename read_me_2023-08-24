*******   REQUEST to PAKE: Put a fully usable example for each major piece.
(OR clear instructions how to get the files from Zenodo)

We can base everything on this 4 hour block from the FAST data.
Currently I have "waveforms.mat". But should also have
- File from which I can extract waveforms (0-4 hrs.)
- Ground Truth spike time lists, but only for those 4 hours.
- Spike times from the 3 sorted blocks (I have waveforms only)

*******************************


-- Run ./PostSorter-PreAnalysis  readjust_spTime_from_bin_ms.m to adjust spike times for blocks that do not start at ground truth time t=0, or that span a 4 hour chunk


**************************
-- Run /SpikeTrainSimilarity spike_train_hits.m to generate ground truth and sorted spike times clipped to the desired time window of analysis. These generate 'st1' and 'st2' that are used by other scripts. *RECOMMENDED TO RUN SECTION BY SECTION IGNORING THE SECTION %% OPTION to process kilosort (KS) sorter output *

**** REQUEST To PAKE: This script is way too complicated! Can we extract the piece where we pick out and save the right spike times??


-- Waveform scripts are in ./ExtractWaveforms. Modify extract_multi_unit_wf.m to generate and save waves in a cell structure.

-- ./SpikeTrainSimilarity plot_ccg_script.m for cross correlogram plots.

-- Remember to adjust paths in set_main_path.m for local directories.
