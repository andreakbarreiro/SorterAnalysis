-- Run ./PostSorter-PreAnalysis  readjust_spTime_from_bin_ms.m to adjust spike times for blocks that do not start at ground truth time t=0, or that span a 4 hour chunk

-- Run /SpikeTrainSimilarity spike_train_hits.m to generate ground truth and sorted spike times clipped to the desired time window of analysis. These generate 'st1' and 'st2' that are used by other scripts. *RECOMMENDED TO RUN SECTION BY SECTION IGNORING THE SECTION %% OPTION to process kilosort (KS) sorter output *

-- Waveform scripts are in ./ExtractWaveforms. Modify extract_multi_unit_wf.m to generate and save waves in a cell structure.

-- ./SpikeTrainSimilarity plot_ccg_script.m for cross correlogram plots.

-- Remember to adjust paths in set_main_path.m for local directories.
